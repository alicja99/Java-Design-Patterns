<h1 id="java-design-patterns">Java Design Patterns</h1>
<p>Repository has been created to learn basic design patterns such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singleton</li>
<li>Builder</li>
<li>Prototype</li>
<li>Factory</li>
<li>AbstractFactory</li>
</ul>
<p>and UnitTesting with the use of JUnit.<br>
Each package contains the implementation of the pattern.<br>
Package test contains test for every</p>
<h2 id="singleton">Singleton</h2>
<p>Pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one “single” instance.</p>
<h2 id="builder">Builder</h2>
<p>The Builder pattern allows us to write readable, understandable code to set up complex objects, instead of creating Objects with tons of variables in a constructor.</p>
<h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>
<p>The Prototype pattern is generally <strong>used when we have an instance of the class (prototype) and we’d like to create new objects by just copying the prototype</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="factory">Factory</h2>
<p>**Factory Method Pattern just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.</p>
<h2 id="abstractfactory">AbstractFactory</h2>
<p>The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.</p>
